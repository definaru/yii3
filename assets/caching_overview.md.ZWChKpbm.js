On the server-side, at the lower level, cache may be used to store basic data, such as a list of most recent article information fetched from the database; and at the higher level, cache may be used to store fragments or whole of Web pages, such as the rendering result of the most recent articles. On the client-side, HTTP caching may be used to keep most recently visited page content in the browser cache.</p><p>Yii supports all these caching mechanisms:</p><ul><li><a href="./data.html">Data caching</a></li><li><a href="./fragment.html">Fragment caching</a></li><li><a href="./page.html">Page caching</a></li><li><a href="./http.html">HTTP caching</a></li></ul>',5),r=[n];function h(o,s,l,d,p,m){return t(),a("div",null,r)}const _=e(c,[["render",h]]);export{g as __pageData,_ as default};
